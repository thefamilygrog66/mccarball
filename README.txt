Mob Capture Containment And Release Ball (mccarball) mod for Minetest


by thefamilygrog66

Description:
A spherical device that, when placed next to a mob, captures and contains said mob. The player can then pick up the ball and store it in their inventory until they wish to release the mob by placing the ball on the ground, on a wall, etc. By default, this mod works with PilzAdam's Simple Mobs (mobs) mod, though it will likely work with other mob mods (just adjust the array at the beginning of init.lua accordingly).

Recipe:

wool:orange | wool:orange | wool:orange
---------------------------------------
wool:black  | wool:white  | wool:black
---------------------------------------
wool:yellow | wool:yellow | wool:yellow

Mod dependencies: mobs, default, wool
